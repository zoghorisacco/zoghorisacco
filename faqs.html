                                    <p>A loan guarantor in a SACCO (Savings and Credit Cooperative Organization) plays a crucial role in ensuring the security and repayment of loans and their roles and responsibilities are:
                                        <ol>
                                            <li><strong>Co-Signer/Endorser: </strong>A guarantor acts as a co-signer for the loan, providing an additional layer of security for the SACCO. If the borrower defaults on the loan, the guarantor is responsible for repaying the outstanding amounts</li>
                                            <li><strong>Oversight: </strong>A guarantor is encouraged to keep track of the borrower's progress in repaying the loan. This proactive approach helps ensure that payments are made on time and in full</li>
                                            <li><strong>Legal Obligation: </strong>Once a guarantor agrees to guarantee a loan, they are legally bound to the terms of the loan agreement. If the borrower fails to make payments, the SACCO has the right to demand payment from the guarantor</li>
                                            <li><strong>Assurance of Repayment: </strong>By guaranteeing the loan, the guarantor assures the SACCO that the loan will be repaid, even if the borrower faces financial difficulties</li>
                                            <li><strong>Social Collateral: </strong>In SACCOs, the guarantor system acts as a form of social collateral, leveraging trust and community ties to ensure loan repayment</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </p>
