                    <p>We will retain your Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include: <br>•
                        The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the Services); <br>• Whether there is a legal obligation to which
                        we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or <br>• Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as
                        in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).</p>
                    <h3>14. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
                    <p> The security of Personal Information is a high priority at ZOGHORI SACCO. We seek to use reasonable technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect Personal Information within our organization. Unfortunately, no data transmission

                    <h3>15. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
